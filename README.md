# Whenever you come up with an Idea, A Concept, You will have to turn it into a reality
How?
# Think, Think about the concept of your game, What is your game like?
Write down a paragraph with a clear and idealistic description of your game 
# Then think about the gameplay,

# Then think about what you require to develop the game
# How is your game going to be like? What is gonna be in your game? Why? Does it make you wanna play it?
# what features does it have? What is so special about this feature? Why do you want to implement this feature and how are you going to implement this features? How does this feature affect and contribute towards the game?
# OR you can skip all these, and just write down as many ideas you can about the game you are going to create
# Then only you start thinking about the 3d models, SFX AND BGM, Controls , Gameplay and player interaction
